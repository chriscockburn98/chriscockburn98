# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Chris

Specialising in full-stack development and DevOps. I bring deep and extensive experience to Soar Tech, where I drive innovation, implement feature-rich functionality, improve development processes, and ensure smooth deployments and operations.

Passionate about exploring different software architectures, I love creating applications that balance complexity and simplicity. This curiosity drives me to experiment with new technologies and architectural patterns, enhancing my problem-solving skills and keeping me updated with the latest industry trends. With a lot of recent influence of AI and AI Agents, I am very interested in how this will change the future of software engineering.

Committed to writing clean, maintainable code, I value best practices such as agile methodologies and CI/CD pipelines. My dedication to continuous learning and problem-solving motivates me to grow both personally and professionally.
